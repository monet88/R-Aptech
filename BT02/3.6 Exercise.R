# Find what arguments the sample() function takes. We will need that for later.

# Find out what arguments the median function takes. While calling the median for the lvl object, try setting the na.rm = argument to TRUE. 

# Does R return a different value from the one when na.rm = is set to FALSE (NB: the default value for the na.rm = argument is FALSE; this means that whenever we do not explicitly specify that it must be set to TRUE, it is set to FALSE)? 
# Yes, when the na.rm argument of a function in R is set to FALSE (which is the default value if not specified), it means that the function will not remove any missing values (NA) from the calculation.
  
# Now try the same command but with the atk variable. 

# Is the output different? Why do you think that is?
