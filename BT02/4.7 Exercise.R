# Create a vector s that stores the number sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30. Use the seq() command to do that.

# Check the attributes of s.

# Does it have any dimensions?
  
# Give it dimensions. Try specifying 3 rows and 5 columns.

# What happens if we try to go beyond the traditional height and width properties and specify a value for depth, too. Let's create a hypercube that has 1 row, 3 columns and 5 "slices".

# Try assigning the following dimensions to s: 1, 3, 5.

# Can you do more than that? Do you think this could be useful for something?

Multidimensional data representation: Higher-dimensional structures can be used to represent and analyze multidimensional data. For example, if you have data with multiple attributes or variables that vary across different dimensions, a higher-dimensional structure can help organize and analyze the data more efficiently.

Tensor computations: Higher-dimensional structures can be used to perform computations involving tensors, which are multidimensional arrays. Tensors arise in various fields, such as physics, machine learning, and signal processing. Higher-dimensional structures can enable efficient manipulation and analysis of tensor data.

Spatial or temporal data: Higher-dimensional structures can be useful for representing and analyzing spatial or temporal data. For example, in geographic information systems (GIS), higher-dimensional structures can be used to represent data across different dimensions, such as latitude, longitude, elevation, and time.

Simulation and modeling: Higher-dimensional structures can be used to model complex systems or simulate processes that involve multiple dimensions. For example, in climate modeling, higher-dimensional structures can capture the spatial and temporal variations of climate variables.
